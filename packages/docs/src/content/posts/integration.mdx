Under the hood of a QC widget there is a player SDK that is used to control the player. You can use the same SDK to control the player inside the widget from your application.

## widget.getSdk(): Promise&lt;PlayerSdk&gt;
Create a widget instance and specify the `sdkUrl` property. The SDK will be loaded asynchronously and instantiated.

The `sdkUrl` property should point to the player SDK that you want to use. It may be the npm registry url or your own CDN url.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://<customer-domain>/widgets/application.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  const widget = KV.widget({
    "guid": "S0m3Gu1D",
    "type": "playback",
    "sdkUrl": "https://unpkg.com/@enghouse-qumu/player-sdk@<version>/dist/index.umd.js",
  });

  widget.getSdk().then((sdk) => {
    sdk.addEventListener('timeupdate', (newTime) => console.log('timeupdate', newTime));

    sdk.getDuration().then((duration) => console.log('duration', duration));

    sdk.play();
  });
</script>
```
